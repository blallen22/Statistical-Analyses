# survey-analyses
This captures R code for conducting survey analyses. Chunks include variable creation, data cleaning, proportion/sd/n/mean tables, significance testing, correlation matrices, snake plot, multiple linear regression models, k-means clustering, and elastic net regression. Note: sensitive information has been protected by the removal of certain variables and certain functions, such as an important false discovery rate control.

Prequisites:

Ensure that R (https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and R Studio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) have been installed.

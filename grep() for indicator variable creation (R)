# grep() provides a more elegant method for cleaning certain variable types, especially creating indicator variables by searching a string
# this is especially effective for cleaning variables that have outputs such as "1,3,4,5,6,7"
# for example, consider a survey question where respondents can select all responses that apply
# if a respondent selects responses 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 10, the output would be "1,3,5,6,8,10"
# grep() can search this string to help create indicator variables for each selected response
# to ensure that grep doesn't erroneously select "10" when searching for "1", you can append a "," to the beginning and end of the string
# check out the grep() documentation here: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.3/topics/grep

# the below assumes that survey question 8 is a "select all that apply" question
# it also assumes that we want to create indicator variables for each selected response

# Q8 includes the complete response string
# Q8.1 should ultimately become an indicator variable that shows a respondent selected response #1 in question 8
Q8.1 <- Q8

# remove any NA values
Q8.1[Q8.1=="#NULL!"|Q8.1==""|Q8.1=="#N/A"] <- NA
Q8.1 <- droplevels(Q8.1)

# define levels and ensure it's a factor
Q8.1 <- factor(Q8.1, levels=c(levels(Q8.1), "1", "0"))

# apply the grep function to search and define
Q8.1[grep(",1,", Q8.1)] <- 1
Q8.1[Q8.1!="1"] <- 0

# drop any other levels
Q8.1 <- droplevels(Q8.1)
